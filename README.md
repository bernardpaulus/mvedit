MVEDIT
======

Move/delete multiple files at once!

This opens an editor with one line per file of the current directory.

* Editing the filename on the line renames the file.
* Emptying the line deletes the file.

Happy directory editing!



When you're done, any help/idea/contribution is welcome! 
Cookies also are, but their rate of survival is quite low :D
