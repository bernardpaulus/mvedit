Move/delete multiple files at once!
===================================

**downloads: see tags tab**

mvedit opens an editor with one line per file of the current directory, so that
you can edit your directory, perform search & replace, ...

* Editing the filename on the line renames the file.
* Emptying the line deletes the file.

Happy directory editing!



When you're done, any help/idea/contribution is welcome!
