Move/delete multiple files at once!

This opens an editor with one line per file of the current directory.

* Editing the filename on the line renames the file.
* Emptying the line deletes the file.

Happy directory editing!

Beware, special things like exchanging the names of two files or moving two
files to the same filename is still not handled.
